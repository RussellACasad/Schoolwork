This app is just for easier addition of items to the internal item string, and allows me to preview
what the items look like without having to do a bunch of testing in-app to randomly get the item, or to
have to rig the system to get the item I need to test 

tldr: im lazy, this isn't the navigation app, just somethin to help me be lazy
